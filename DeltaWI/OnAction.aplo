 result←action(obj OnAction)args;todo
 ⍝ Check object to see if it has onAction processing to perform.
 ⍝ If so, perform it and return any result. Otherwise just return a continuation signal.

 :If '*'≠⊃action ⍝ A '*' prefix means to ignore any onAction handling
 :AndIf 2=obj.⎕NC'_onAction' ⍝ Has anything been defined here?
 :AndIf ×≢todo←obj._onAction
⍝? Set up ∆W* variables
     Run todo
⍝? Check ∆W* variables to see if processing has been handled or needs to be continued normally
⍝? If the onAction event calls ∆WI '*', how can we detect that there so we know to continue processing?
 :EndIf

 result←⎕NULL ⍝? For now, just assume there are no onActions to do
